## Single neuron spiking activity
To see the responses of each single neuron to the stimulated input and has proper spiking pattern
the behaviour of one single spiking neuron could be reported in certain timestep window.

## Raster plot to observe spiking sctivity of population of neurons.
Raster gragh shows the spiking activity of a population of spiking Neurons.
